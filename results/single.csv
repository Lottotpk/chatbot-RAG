You can create a button using the following steps:

1.  **Create a button:** Use the `mo.ui.button()` function to create a button with a label and a click handler.
2.  **Set the value:**  Set the button's value to 0 initially.
3.  **Increment the value:** Increment the button's value on every click.
4.  **Get the value:** Use `button.value` to retrieve the current value of the button.
5.  **Toggle the button:** Use `mo.ui.button()` to create a toggle button.
6.  **Implement a state:** Use `mo.state()` to store the index of the clicked button.
7.  **Create an array of buttons:** Create an array of `mo.ui.button()` objects.
8.  **Add buttons to the array:** Populate the array with buttons.
9.  **Get the state value:** Use `get_state()` to get the state of the array.
10. **Arrange buttons in a table column:** Use `mo.ui.array()` to create an array of buttons and arrange them in a table column.
11. **Execute side-effects:** Use `mo.hstack()` to arrange buttons in a column.

9,What is the meaning behind the infrared scenes?,"The significance of the use of infrared might be in stating how the Polish family cannot be themselves as soon as they step out of their house or into the open balcony as well. Although the girl takes on the dangerous responsibility of helping the prisoners, she still cannot express her true self in public, leading to her being shown in infrared. Another perspective is that the girl and her mother truly stand out in this horrific world solely because of their generous actions. Therefore, in a film like this, in which the Nazis and the enablers are the “normal” people, anyone with any sense of humanity has to be visually differentiated from the Hoss family members.",The infrared scenes signify how the family cannot be themselves as soon as they step out of their house or into the open balcony as well.
