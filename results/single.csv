1,What do the giants look like?,"One giant is burly, grey-skinned, and 20 feet tall. It wears heavy dark iron armour covered in metal torns. It is leaning against a chamber wall, carrying what looks to be two tower shields nearly as tall as itself, both bearing
menacing spikes.

The other giant  stands a tall giant in more mobile iron, clutching a dangerous-looking maul the size of Yasha, also leaning and looking disinterested.","The giants are described as a burly, grey-skinned giant with heavy armor of dark iron riddled with metal torns. They are around 20 feet tall and carry two tower shields nearly as tall as themselves, both bearing menacing spikes. They also appear to be leaning against the chamber wall, carrying what looks like two tower shields. The giants are also described as being timid, but know the tunnels well."
1,What happens on day 2?,"After a few miles of winding tunnel, you emerge in a smaller grotto of stalactites and stalagmites dripping with condensation. Unsure if the same underground river, or another water source, is nearby, you can see quite a bit of ground water does funnel down into this area.

You encounter 2 ropers seeking the next burrowed entrance left by the Kryn.","After a few miles of winding tunnel, you emerge in a smaller grotto of stalactites and stalagmites dripping with condensation."
2,What were the requirements for the project?,"The tool had the following requirements:
- Chatbot that you can ask questions and get answers in response (conversational memory is not required).
- Information is taken from an unstructured text file.
- It must be able to tell me if it doesn’t know the answer to my question.
- Fast.
- Efficient enough to run on my MacBook with other programs without any performance issues.
- Locally run for privacy and to ensure it will always be free, runnable, and consistent.","The project’s primary requirements centered around a lightweight, locally runnable system for STICI-note.  It needed to be fast and compatible with a MacBook. The goal was to build a prototype to validate the feasibility of the idea.  Evaluating solutions is crucial – without evaluation, it’s impossible to know if a solution is effective.  The project’s plan involves a phased approach, starting with a tech stack and data flow, culminating in a prototype to assess and compare options.  The available code is accessible for this project’s planning and development."
2,What data did was used to test the prototype?,Grace Hopper's Wikipedia page and Alan Turing's Wikipedia page were used to test the prototype.,The prototype was tested with two versions: one with Grace Hopper’s Wikipedia page and one with Alan Turing’s Wikipedia page. The question asked: “What programming language was Grace Hopper known for creating?” The version with Alan Turing’s Wikipedia page hallucinated an entire response. The tech stack and data flow for the prototype were planned and built to determine model size and precision. Models were tested on the Hugging Face H4 Open LLM Leaderboard.
3,How do the data storage options compare?,"For fast start: use SQLite3 and ChromaDB (File-based) out-of-the-box - no install required.
For speed + scale: use MongoDB (text collection) and Milvus (vector db) - install with Docker Compose
For postgres: use Postgres for both text collection and vector DB - install with Docker Compose
For mix-and-match: LLMWare supports 3 text collection databases (Mongo, Postgres, SQLite) and 10 vector databases (Milvus, PGVector-Postgres, Neo4j, Redis, Mongo-Atlas, Qdrant, Faiss, LanceDB, ChromaDB and Pinecone).","Here’s a comparison of the data storage options presented in the context:

*   **SQLite3 and ChromaDB (File-based):** Out-of-the-box, no installation required.
*   **MongoDB (text collection):** Requires installation with Docker Compose.
*   **Postgres:** Requires installation with Docker Compose.
*   **Milvus (vector db):** Requires installation with Docker Compose.
*   **SLIM model series:** Fine-tuned for function calling and multi-step, multi-model Agent workflows.
*   **DRAGON model series:** Production-grade RAG-optimized 6-7B parameter models.
*   **Mix-and-Match:** Supports 3 text collection databases (Mongo, Postgres, SQLite) and 10 vector databases (Milvus, PGVector-Postgres, Neo4j, Redis, Mongo-Atlas, Qdrant, Faiss, LanceDB, ChromaDB and Pinecone)."
3,When was UTF-8 support added for European languages?,UTF-8 support was added for European languages on Wednesday 3rd April in the v0.2.7 Update.,"UTF-8 encoding for European languages was added in Version 0.8. The update was made on January 19, 2024."
4,How do I make a button?,"import marimo as mo

button = mo.ui.run_button()
button

mo.stop(not button.value, ""Click 'run' to generate a random number"")

import random
random.randint(0, 1000).","I can help with that! To create a button, you can use the `mo.ui.button` component and its `on_click` argument to increment a counter value.  Then, you can use `mo.ui.table.create_buttons` to create a button array and pass it to `mo.ui.table.display`.  The `on_click` argument increments the counter value on each click.  You can also use `mo.stop` to stop the counter when a button is clicked."
4,When might I use caching?,"You might use caching when, for example, your notebook computes t-SNE, UMAP, or PyMDE embeddings.","Caching is useful when compute_predictions is called with the same parameters repeatedly, instead of recomputing the predictions. The function will store the previous value in a cache and return it the next time. This speeds up notebook execution and reduces redundant computations. Cache is particularly helpful for expensive intermediate computations like t-SNE or UMAP embeddings."
5,What are the key topics of this article?,"The key topics of this article are: ""why prioritizing impact matters not just for managers, but also ICs""; ""why focusing on impact is hard""; ""how to maximize your impact""; and ""how to overcome common challenges in driving real impact"".","The article discusses prioritizing impact, overcoming challenges in driving real impact, and minimizing wasted time on projects that don’t deliver. It highlights the importance of a clear recommendation and warns against “impact killers” like academic projects that don’t connect to business needs. The article emphasizes that delivering value for the audience is crucial, rather than simply outlining data."
5,Do I have to do something all by myself to be acknowledged for it?,"You don’t have to be solely responsible for something in order to take (partial) credit for it. If you provided the analysis that resulted in a pricing change that saved the company millions, then you deserve part of the credit for that impact.","You don’t have to be solely responsible for something to take partial credit for it. If your analysis saved the company millions, you deserve part of the credit. Obsessing over response times and satisfaction scores isn’t the best approach. Managers may not always do a perfect job, and you’ll bear the consequences of poorly scoped work. Ultimately, you have control over your effort and deliverables, but don’t guarantee business advancement."
6,What kinds of models would need to be officially registered?,"High-risk AI systems that are deployed by public authorities or entities acting on their behalf will have to be registered in a public EU database, unless those systems are used for law enforcement and migration. The latter will have to be registered in a non-public part of the database that will be only accessible to relevant supervisory authorities.",Model providers need to register their models in a non-public part of the database that is only accessible to relevant supervisory authorities. Market surveillance authorities will support post-market monitoring through audits and by offering providers the possibility to report on serious incidents or breaches of fundamental rights obligations of which they have become aware.  Providers of free and open-source models are exempted from most of these obligations.
6,"What kinds of AI carry ""systematic risks""?","For now, general purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks, given that models trained with larger compute tend to be more powerful. The AI Office (established within the Commission) may update this threshold in light of technological advances, and may furthermore in specific cases designate other models as such based on further criteria (e.g. number of users, or the degree of autonomy of the model).","The AI Act considers systemic risks arising from general-purpose AI models, including large generative AI models. These models can be used for various tasks and pose systemic risks due to their widespread adoption. The Act defines high-risk AI systems based on their potential to cause harm across multiple applications. Identifying these systems requires a clear definition of “high-risk” within the legal framework."
7,Which quest does the emperor give the player?,"The emperor gives the player the ""Visit the Emperor's Old Hideout"" quest.","The Emperor initiates the quest to visit the Emperor’s Old Hideout. This hideout allows the player to better get to know the Emperor. The Emperor serves as a guide and unlikely ally to the party, protecting their minds from the influence of the Absolute through the use of the prisoner within the Astral Prism. The player’s choices in prior conversations influence the player’s attitude towards illithids and the Emperor."
7,Who ambushes the party at Wyrm's lookout?,"On the way to Baldur's Gate, the party will be ambushed by a group of Gish'ra warriors while resting at Wyrm's Lookout.",A group of Gish'ra warriors.
8,What did I drink at the pintxo bars?,You drank txakoli at the pintxo bars.,The text doesn’t specify what drinks were consumed at the pintxo bars. It only mentions txakoli.
8,Which part of the trip did I like the most?,Your favourite part of the trip was your four days on the Camino.,"The text describes a trip filled with enjoyable experiences, including shopping in Madrid, enjoying meals and cocktails, and hiking the camino. It also highlights a memorable meal at Charrúa Madrid and a fun evening at Ficus Bar. The speaker enjoyed the overall experience and plans to return to the camino someday."
9,What is the meaning behind the infrared scenes?,"The significance of the use of infrared might be in stating how the Polish family cannot be themselves as soon as they step out of their house or into the open balcony as well. Although the girl takes on the dangerous responsibility of helping the prisoners, she still cannot express her true self in public, leading to her being shown in infrared. Another perspective is that the girl and her mother truly stand out in this horrific world solely because of their generous actions. Therefore, in a film like this, in which the Nazis and the enablers are the “normal” people, anyone with any sense of humanity has to be visually differentiated from the Hoss family members.","The infrared scenes signify the family’s inability to express themselves fully in public, reflecting their hidden existence within the confines of Auschwitz. This suggests a lack of autonomy and a struggle to maintain their true selves despite the oppressive circumstances. The scenes depict a young girl’s wandering around the camp, seeking meager sustenance, highlighting her isolation and vulnerability.  The change in infrared visuals upon returning home indicates a return to a controlled, albeit unsettling, reality."
9,How do the people who commit atrocious acts and those that are complicit in these acts differ?,The Zone of Interest does not really differentiate between evil-doers and those supporting such evil.,"The text suggests that Rudolf is definitively categorized as someone who enjoys the torture and killing of people, regardless of their involvement. The Hoss children also exhibit a similar level of desensitization to violence. Jonathan Glazer’s film highlights the impact of systematized violence and the tendency of the masses to support oppressors. The elderly woman displays no sympathy for the prisoners, yet is overwhelmed by the constant reminders of death. Rudolf’s actions, driven by a desire for stronger gas chambers, demonstrate a clear commitment to participating in horrific acts."
10,What is the policy on Tai Chi?,"In order to calm down the passions and stresses currently exhibited in Parliament, the Loony Party would make all M.P’s have half an hours compulsory Tai chi everyday.",The Loony Party would make all M.P’s have half an hours compulsory Tai chi everyday.
10,What is the proposed change for the British museum,The British Museum should have a Daddy’s section alongside the current Mummy exhibition.,"The proposed change for the British Museum is to add a “Daddy’s” section alongside the current Mummy exhibition. There will also be a yellow line system for parking only. The Civil Service will be extended to all branches of government, with Alec Stewart as wicket-keeper."
11,How much faster is the Tesla A100 compared to the Tesla V100?,"When measured on the SE-ResNeXt101 deep learning architecture, the Tesla A100 was 1.43x faster than the Tesla V100. When measured on the Masked-R-CNN deep learning architecture the Tesla A100 was 1.47x faster than the Tesla V100. When measured on the Transformer (12 layer, Machine Translation, WMT14 en-de) deep learning architecture, the Tesla A100 was 1.70x faster than the Tesla V100.","The Tesla A100 offers a speedup of 1.73x over the Tesla V100, as indicated by the figures."
11,For what work did I receive criticism for my reduction of FLOPS?,You received criticism for your research on sparse network training.,"I received criticism for my algorithm’s reduction of FLOPS, specifically because GPUs cannot perform fast sparse matrix multiplication. The addition of Tensor Core support significantly improved speedups, up to 2x during training. Figure 3 describes my algorithm’s three stages: determine importance of layers."
12,How does function exporting differ between Gleam and Python?,"In Python, top level functions are exported by default. There is no notion of private module-level functions. In Gleam, functions are private by default and need the pub keyword to be public.","In Gleam, functions are private by default and require the `pub` keyword to be public. Python allows for overloaded Python operators and can be used with any type. Gleam functions are declared using a syntax similar to Rust or JavaScript, with no special syntax for module function assignment."
12,What is the syntax for pipe,The operator for Pipe in Gleam is '|>'.,Pipe in Gleam is represented by the `|>` operator. It can pipe into anonymous functions.
13,Why are the top-right values in the raw attention weights set to negative infinity?,A mask of negative infinity is applied to the upper right entries of the raw attention weights to ensure they will zero out after softmax.,The top-right values in the raw attention weights are set to negative infinity because they represent zeros in the lower-triangular attention weight matrix. This ensures that future tokens will not be included in the representation of a given token.  Each row of the attention weight matrix specifies “how much” each other token goes into the representation for any given token. Scaling the attention weights by the inverse square root of head_size ensures unit variance. We also apply dropout to the attention weights.
13,How can I freeze a variable during training in MLX?,"To freeze an attribute during training, you can add '_' as a prefix to the attribute name, which signals to mlx that it is not a parameter and should not be updated during training.","MLX allows you to freeze a variable using the `_causal_mask`. This mask is applied to the attribute name `_causal_mask` which marks it as a private variable.  You can update the model parameters using `mx.update()`. Finally, `mx.eval()` ensures the model and optimizer state are updated."
14,How is the narrator related to Perry,Perry is the narrator's brother.,"The narrator is related to Perry. They share a sibling bond and have similar experiences of loss, including a fire that separated them. They also have a childhood connection and reminisce about past events like s’mores and fireplace movies."
14,How long has the narrator been sober for?,The author had been sober for seven hundred and thirty days.,The narrator has been sober for exactly seven hundred and thirty days.
15,What is the name of the space station?,"The space station is called ""Babystation Beta"".",The name of the space station is [Space station].
15,What languages do the people of Pacifico del Rio speak?,All of the humans speak a single language that is similar to Cantonese.,"The people of Pacifico del Rio speak English. They exist because English is a common language here. The Tardis translate, helping people fit into every time and place. The Doctor states that humans all speak one language by this point, similar to Cantonese. Rico Trieste is signing off under protest, and Jocelyn is referring to the DuBarryDuPlessy world."
16,In which patch was pet adoption added?,The ability to adopt pets from Marnie's shop from year two was added in patch 1.6.3.,"Stardew Valley 1.02 was released on February 27, 2016. The pet adoption feature was added during this patch. Changes were made to the multiplayer system, including fixing remote players not showing jump/jitter animations and resolving issues with host players seeing flashes or controller rumbles. Several stability fixes were also included."
16,When did mushroom trees stop dropping wood?,Mushrrom trees stopped dropping wood in patch 1.4.0.,"Mushroom trees stopped dropping wood due to fixed heavy tappers not being tracked correctly. This issue caused problems like ignored heavy-tapped trees when creating mushroom trees in fall. Subsequently, brown slimes now drop wood, and botanist perks now apply to items dropped from trees like coconuts.  The mushroom trees now produce white debris chunks instead of brown, and festivals allow for increased friendship through NPC conversations. Finally, Linux now handles empty spaces and sorts stacks by quantity, improving processing time for tapped mushroom trees."
17,Where was Alan Wake 2 officially announced?,Alan Wake 2 was officially announced at The Game Awards 2021.,"Alan Wake 2 was officially announced on digital storefronts for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC through the Epic Games Store."
17,When is this game set?,"This game is set in 2023, thirteen years after the events of Alan Wake.","The game is set in 2023, as the game was delayed by 10 days to October 27, 2023, and the expansion DLCs Night Springs and The Lake House are slated for release later."
18,Who wrote 'Divine Rivals'?,Rebecca Ross wrote 'Divine Rivals'.,Rebecca Ross wrote ‘Divine Rivals’.
18,Who was resurrected with a group of other murder victims?,Lou was resurrected along with a handful of other women murdered by a single serial killer.,"Lou was resurrected along with a handful of other women murdered by a single serial killer. The victims all responded to their deaths differently, questioning their culpability. The politics of resurrection in her world are complicated, and few people qualify. This sets the stage for a unique sci-fi twist on the survivor story."
19,What categories does this paper split the RAG technique paradigm into?,"This paper organizes the RAG paradigm into four categories: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation.","This paper splits the RAG technique paradigm into four categories: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation. It outlines these phases in Section 2. The workflow of RAG is detailed in Section 3, categorizing methodologies into pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation phases. The paper also introduces evaluation methods and future research directions."
19,In what way can including unrelated documents affect the RAG system?,"Noise Power (Cuconasu et al., 2024) provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of IR components on RAG systems, revealing that the inclusion of irrelevant documents can significantly improve accuracy.","Including unrelated documents can obscure the intrinsic connections between retrieval steps and potentially hinder the system’s overall performance. The index created from external sources, while crucial, may not fully capture the relevance of all documents. Disconnecting steps within the workflow could lead to a fragmented understanding of the information retrieval process. This lack of coherence could make it difficult to identify optimal strategies for improvement. Ultimately, the system’s ability to effectively leverage external knowledge is compromised by the presence of irrelevant data."
