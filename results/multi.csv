Jackie saw a translucent memmory of her dad sitting motionless at a table with an empty glass of Apple-Schnapple and an empty bottle of Jim Beam. Jackie also remembered he father giving her beer as a child and her mother ignoring this.

She used the death of her parents as an excuse for her alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster she would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing she had been too weak to conquer the addiction from her own volition just made the weapon twist in her chest.
