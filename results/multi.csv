6,What are the risk classifications for AI?,"The risk classifications are: ""minimal risk"", ""high-risk"", ""unacceptable risk"", and ""specific transparency risk""","The Commission proposes four levels of risk for AI systems, with specific risks for general-purpose models. These levels are Minimal risk, Obligations do not apply to research and prototyping preceding the market, and AI systems exclusively for military, defence or national security purposes. Systems performing narrow procedural tasks, improving previous human activities, or solely preparatory tasks are not considered high-risk. An AI system is considered high-risk if it performs profiling of natural persons."
6,What are the rules for developing general purpose AI models?,"General purpose AI models that were trained using a total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs are considered to carry systemic risks. 12 months after the AI Act enters into force, the obligations for general purpose AI governance become applicable. Providers of general purpose AI models, which are trained on large data amounts and therefore prone to high energy consumption, are required to disclose energy consumption. Providers of free and open-source models are exempted from most of obligations, but this exemption does not cover obligations for providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks.","The Commission is encouraging industry associations to adopt voluntary codes of conduct for general-purpose AI models. These codes of practice work by inviting providers to jointly develop them. The Commission invites providers to collaborate on a code of practice, which can then be used by these models to demonstrate compliance with the AI Act. The focus is on ensuring responsible development and use of these models."

19,What is the recommended way to index text for question-answering?,"It is recommended to first apply text normalization processes such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of stop words to enhance the text’s suitability for indexing. Pretrained LMs can then be used to generate semantic vector representations of texts. These vectors are stored, enabling rapid and precise retrieval from extensive data collections, significantly enhancing retrieval efficiency. Sentence-level indexing is more appropriate than document-level indexing for summarizing documents to precisely locate answers.","For question-answering systems, sentence-level indexing is beneficial for precise answers.  Document-level indexing is better for summarizing and understanding concepts.  Text normalization, such as tokenization and stop word removal, enhances the text’s suitability for indexing. Deep learning has revolutionized indexing with pretrained LMs generating semantic vector representations.  These vectors enable rapid and precise retrieval."
19,What are the advantages and disadvantages of the BM25 algorithm?,"The advantage of BM25 is that it is efficient. The disadvantage of the BM25 algorithm is that it focuses on term frequency and presence for document algorithm, so it often overlooks the semantic information of queries.","The BM25 algorithm, while efficient, often overlooks semantic information. Traditional BM25 is still widely used due to its efficiency, despite advanced language models. While generators utilize advanced language models, many retrievers still rely on the traditional BM25. This reliance hinders exploration of areas for improvement. The rapid evolution of the field means some aspects remain unexplored."
